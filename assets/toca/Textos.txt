A1-Ring
Hello 0. You've gotten an opportunity to race. If you want to join the elite of this business, you'd better win the race. If you don't, there is only oblivion for you...
Catalunya
You did well 0. Thanks to your last victory, the spotlight is now on you. You need to win more races to be among the best. Let's go! Failure is not an option.
Nurburgring
0, if you win this race, you'll earn the respect from the best racers of this category including mine. From now on, you'll race against the best, and I'll upgrade the parts of your car, only if you win, of course.
Kyalami
This is getting serious, 0. You'll be racing against real racers this time, none of those wimps with helmets from the last three races. These new tires are top-notch, kid. You can't lose with them.
Road America
0, you've made a name for yourself in the hall of fame of this competition. Now you gotta keep it up. Today you'll have a new shock absorber system, so get out there and kick those pretentious drivers' butts or I'll be the one kicking your butt.
Manthorp Park
Thanks to your results, I've got you a place in the race of the year. It's the most prestigious race in the circuit, and the winner is considered the best driver of the year. With the money we made so far, I got you a new engine that will send you flying on the track. Go and get them, kid. Don't try, just do it.
Very good. See you in next race.
You almost did it, kid. You need more guts.
You're the worst kiddo. You don't deserve to race in this category.
Go home and play with your toy cars, kid.
